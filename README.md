# PrepAlly

We‚Äôre building PrepAlly to fill a critical gap in coding interview preparation. Current tools offer practice but fall short of providing the interactive, AI-driven insights candidates need to feel truly prepared. Interviews are still notoriously stressful, leaving candidates feeling unprepared despite available resources. PrepAlly changes that by delivering real-time feedback and personalized insights, empowering candidates with the confidence and readiness to ace their interviews.
